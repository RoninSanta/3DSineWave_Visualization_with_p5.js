# 3DSineWave Visualization using p5.js
A webpage that visualizes 3D sine waveforms with the help of p5.js

### [Instructions]
This is a built using the p5.js library so therefore make sure that the p5 library is installed on your IDE(Visual Studio Code, etc..) before running the project. For VSCode users make sure to install the 'live-server' extension and right click the **index.html** file and choose the `Open with Live Server` option and the game will run on a HTML window on your browser. 

This is a simple project that I made that helps to visualize 3D sine waves by using 3D cubes and observe how they move up and down:

- This is achieved by using the physics element and controlling the Length of each cube boxes with response to a wave.
- There are sliders that can control the `speed of wave`, the `height of cubes` and `size of entire Grid`
- The Speed will be affected by the total size and the height since it requires more computational power
